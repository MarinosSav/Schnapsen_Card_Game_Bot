Abstract

This research paper investigates the performance of the intelligent agent “Mantis”, designed for the card game Schnapsen. The agent can predict the opponent’s hand by using permutation tables. 
We analyzed several plays of the game in order to determine how Mantis, our intelligent agent, can successfully predict the cards and how this information can be used to win the game, more specifically by playing against other bots that use different strategies.
We explain what Schnapsen consists of and what are the rules and plays on this “trick” game. Also, we state the skills and facts about the different intelligent agents used in the plays performed against our Intelligent Agent, Mantis, which are: Rand, Bully, Anti-Bully, and RDeep. Finally, we elaborate on the agents that may have had an effect on this project, such as Artificial Intelligence, Game theory or Decision making.
